## Outcome:
>**1st Model Result:**
> **Model is saying 75% Heart Disease patients are Male.**
>
>**About The 1st Model:**
> *We are getting the Precision value from the model is 7.5 out of 10. What should be more near to 10. The Accuracy of the model is 63.74%. If the rate would more than 85% and the precision value is greater than 8 then we can say this model is pretty good, the model is not what.* 

>**2nd Model Result:**
> **Model is saying 81.67 % patients has Heart Disease .**
>
>**About The 2nd Model:**
> *We are getting the Precision value from the model is 7.9 out of 10. What should be more near to 10. The Accuracy of the model is 81.67%. If the accuracy rate would more than 85% and the precision value is greater than 8 then we can say this model is pretty good, but the model is not what.*
