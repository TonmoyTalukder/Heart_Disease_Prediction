> **Model is saying 75% Heart Disease patients are Male.**

**About The Model:**
> *We are getting the Precision value from the model is 7.5 out of 10. What should be more near to 10. The Accuracy of the model is 63.74 %. If the rate would more than 85% and the precision value is greater than 8 then we can say this model is pretty good, the model is not what.*
